          <p>Rabbits have specific dietary needs that require attention to ensure their health and well-being. The foundation of a rabbit's diet should be high-quality hay, such as Timothy hay, which provides essential fiber for proper digestion and helps wear down their continuously growing teeth. Fresh vegetables are also essential components of a rabbit's diet, offering vital nutrients and hydration. Leafy greens like kale, spinach, and romaine lettuce are excellent choices, but introduce them gradually to avoid digestive issues. Additionally, rabbits benefit from small amounts of high-quality rabbit pellets, which provide essential vitamins and minerals. However, pellets should only make up a small portion of their diet to prevent obesity and dental problems. Treats, such as fruits, should be given sparingly due to their high sugar content, which can lead to health issues if overconsumed. It's critical to provide fresh, clean water at all times to keep rabbits hydrated and prevent urinary tract problems. Monitoring their diet and adjusting accordingly based on their age, weight, and health status is crucial for maintaining their overall health and longevity.</p>
