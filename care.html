          <p>When it comes to cleaning your rabbit's living space, there are important steps to follow to ensure their health and comfort. Begin by removing any soiled bedding and waste from their enclosure daily, as keeping their living area clean is crucial for preventing health issues. Replace bedding as needed and thoroughly clean the enclosure with a pet-safe cleaner on a regular basis to prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors. Additionally, ensure that their food and water dishes are cleaned and refilled with fresh water daily to maintain their hydration and prevent contamination. However, it's important to avoid using harsh chemicals or strong-smelling cleaning products around rabbits, as they are sensitive to strong scents and chemicals that could harm their respiratory system. Similarly, refrain from bathing rabbits unless absolutely necessary, as they are adept groomers and bathing can cause stress and strip their fur of natural oils. By following these cleaning guidelines and avoiding harsh chemicals and unnecessary baths, you can ensure a safe and comfortable living environment for your rabbit.</p>
